*** This is intended for use by the F2p Starhunt Discord. ***

The map starts off in Grayscale and then as you click target locations, chunks of the map will regain their full color until the entire map is full color.

The clicking functionality is binary, on and off. *TODO*Right now you have to click each region to turn it on or off, but I will include a reset button soon.

The point of this is to be a part of an easy to use system that helps scouts identify which locations have been scouted by others so they never waste their time.

This part of that system mainly is useful for the visual display which allows scouts to quickly glance at a map for information rather than reading through small text.



Additional Information:
F2p Starhunt is a CC or Chat-Channel in Old School Runescape whose members scout locations of shooting stars for all f2p players as a community service.

Shooting stars fall in waves, one star per world or server, which cycle every 93 minutes. Each world has members and f2p areas that stars can spawn in. Within those areas stars spawn in specific locations.

Scouts monitor these special locations where shooting stars fall in all f2p worlds in order to track a star's spawn time relative to the wave cycle timer.

This is important because throughout the first 45 minutes of a wave, and only the first 45 minutes, stars will spawn. 

If a star is still present at a location when it reaches its spawn time then it "poofs" or disappears as a new star falls at a new random location.

Stars that land in members areas on a f2p server are not able to be mined by any player whether they are members or f2p, but they still prevent another star from being at a minable location.

This is why it is somewhat challenging to locate stars in f2p and keep f2p players mining these stars. There are simply many more members areas than f2p and thus most stars are inaccessible in f2p worlds.

Shooting stars have tiers when they spawn which range from 6-9 representing a mining level requirement of 10 times that tiers number and 7 minutes of mining time for each tier.

When a tier is mined for 7 minutes by one or more players then it drops a tier and so on and so forth until it reaches t0 where it is "dusted" or is all mined out and disappears.

It's important to note the distinction between "poof" and "dust" when a star disappears. "Poof" means another star spawned at a different location whereas "dust" simply means the star was mined down to t0.

Scouting for stars at their special locations and managing their respective timers in each of these f2p worlds is the challenge and focus of the F2p Starhunt CC.

The mission of the F2p Starhunt CC is to allow f2p players to mine shooting stars 100% of the time.
